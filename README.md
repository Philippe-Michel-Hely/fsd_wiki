# Full Spectrum Dominance wiki page

A simple but informative wiki regarding all the FSD lore.
Currently still in very early stages, but the goal is to put here all the narrative content and the wordlbuilding work.

## The Wiki
You can access the [statically generated wiki](https://thelazyone.github.io/fsd_wiki/), or if you really want to, you can host it yourself.
Built on the template of the [GIT-WIKI](https://www.drassil.org/git-wiki/main_page) project, which self-deploys the generated wiki upon commit.

## Contribute
If you want to add content to the wiki you can submit a pull request, or you can contact me on the #lore channel [in the discord](https://discord.gg/39exwYM9gn) and I'll try to fit all the content with what's canon already.

## About Full Spectrum Dominance
FSD is a miniature wargame created by Giacomo Pantalone and a universe built with the help of the community and the master of the lore Iain Ross. 
The wiki is open source, but the FSD IP is property of The Lazy Forger, so I'd kindly ask not to reuse it shamelessly.
