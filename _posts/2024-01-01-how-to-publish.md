So, this is the new Full Spectrum Dominance wiki!

## How to contribute to this Wiki

This wiki is mainly maintained by thelazyone. 
Currently the easier way to contribute to the wiki is to contact the maintainer [on discord](https://discord.gg/39exwYM9gn) , but as soon as I write down a better guide it's gonna be possible to directly have PR sent through github.
